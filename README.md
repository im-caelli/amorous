# Amourous
A Korrasami one shot collection.


## NSFW Warning

The works in this portfolio are rated mature/explicit. Read at your own discretion.


## What the fuck is this?

This is Caelli being extra. I make Korrasami fanart sometimes, and wanting to try a hand in fanfics (I imagine this happening rarely, potentially may even be just this once, lol). I'm not particularly great at them but I needed a creative outlet for these fandom feels.  

Long story short, sometimes I make something that involves both, and I want to present it in a way that I probably can't on socials. This project in particular is (potentially) a series of thirsty nsfw Korrasami one shot fics with accompanying fanart.

Also I'm extra af.

### Why this format?

Web Design/Development is also an interest of mine. I actually planned for this to be a little more involved, like an actual personal portfolio site of sorts (for a bunch of stuff, not just this smut story picture book nonsense), as I've wanted to explore new technologies and build something as I learn. But that requires time and I haven't mangaged to finish it. And as personal projects usually goes, may never see the day of light. Haha

So as for right now this is going to be some random unrelated one pagers.
